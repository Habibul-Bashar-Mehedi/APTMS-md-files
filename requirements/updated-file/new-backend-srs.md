## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document defines the complete backend system requirements for the **AI Powered Traveling Management System**. It is prepared in accordance with the IEEE 830 standard and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 guidelines for systems and software engineering requirements.

The purpose of this document is to provide a clear, complete, and unambiguous specification of the backend system's functional behavior, data architecture, security model, performance expectations, and integration interfaces. This document serves as the authoritative technical reference for backend architects, software engineers, database administrators, quality assurance engineers, and academic reviewers involved with this project.

The document focuses exclusively on backend system design and implementation requirements. It does not address frontend presentation, UI/UX design, or client-side behavior.

### 1.2 Scope

The **AI Powered Traveling Management System** is a web-based travel planning platform whose backend system is responsible for all data processing, business logic execution, secure API service delivery, and external service integration. The backend serves three classes of users — Traveler, Vendor, and Admin — each with distinct roles and access permissions.

The backend system encompasses the following capability domains:

- Secure user authentication and role-based authorization using JWT
- User account lifecycle management for all roles
- Hotel and room listing management with vendor ownership enforcement
- Booking lifecycle management from request through confirmation or cancellation
- Transport information storage and retrieval
- Tourist spot directory management
- Traditional food and cultural market data management
- Route and travel time information management
- AI chatbot integration for personalized travel planning
- Comprehensive administrative management across all platform entities

The system is built on Java 25, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL, and Redis, and exposes all functionality through a RESTful API layer consumed by the web-based frontend client.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The backend system of the AI Powered Traveling Management System is an independent, RESTful API server that constitutes the authoritative processing and data layer of the overall platform. It operates as the middle tier in a three-tier web application architecture: the web client (frontend) communicates with the backend through HTTP requests; the backend processes business logic and communicates with its data stores (PostgreSQL and Redis) and external services (AI provider).

The backend is a stateless service — it maintains no server-side session state between requests. All authentication context is carried within the signed JWT token submitted by the client on each protected request. This stateless design makes the backend horizontally scalable and simplifies load distribution as user volume grows.

The backend's responsibilities include enforcing all business rules, validating all incoming data, managing all database interactions, orchestrating the AI service integration, and returning structured JSON responses to the consuming client. It has no awareness of or dependency on how the client renders the data it receives.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

From a backend interaction perspective, the three user classes interact with the system through authenticated API requests as follows.

**Traveler:** A registered end-user who consumes travel information and planning services. Travelers authenticate to access personalized features — AI chat, hotel search, booking submission, and content browsing. They have read access to all public content and write access limited to their own profile, bookings, and AI chat interactions. Travelers are the highest-volume users and generate the majority of read requests to the system.

**Vendor:** A registered business entity representing a hotel or service provider. Vendors are subject to admin approval before gaining full access. Upon approval, vendors have write access to their own hotel and room records, and read/write access to booking requests associated with their properties. Vendors generate moderate volumes of write requests during listing management and booking management activities.

**Admin:** A platform operator with unrestricted access across all system entities. Admins manage user and vendor accounts, approve vendor registrations, manage all content categories, and monitor platform activity. Admins generate lower volumes of requests but require access to the broadest range of data and operations.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

**Assumptions:**

1. All API consumers are web-based clients that communicate with the backend over HTTPS.
2. The external AI provider exposes a stable, documented REST API endpoint that the backend calls to fulfill travel planning requests.
3. The PostgreSQL database instance is pre-configured with the required schemas before application startup.
4. Redis is available as a networked cache service accessible by the backend application.
5. The JWT signing secret is stored securely in environment-specific configuration and is not committed to version control.
6. Vendors are assumed to maintain the accuracy of their own listing data; the backend enforces business rules but cannot automatically verify the truthfulness of vendor-submitted content.
7. The system operates with a single AI provider in this phase; no failover to an alternative provider is implemented.

**Dependencies:**

1. The backend system depends on the availability of the PostgreSQL database for all persistent data operations.
2. The AI integration service depends on the external AI provider's API being available and responsive within the defined timeout window.
3. The Redis caching layer is a non-critical dependency — the system must degrade gracefully to direct database reads if Redis is temporarily unavailable.
4. JWT token validation depends on the consistency of the signing key across all backend instances.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Layered Architecture Description

The backend system is organized into five horizontal layers, each with clearly defined responsibilities and boundaries. No layer should bypass its adjacent layer to access functionality from a non-adjacent layer.

#### Controller Layer (Presentation / API Layer)
The Controller Layer is the topmost backend layer. It receives all incoming HTTP requests, extracts request parameters and body payloads, delegates processing to the appropriate Service Layer component, and formats the service response into a structured JSON HTTP response. Controllers are responsible for request routing, initial DTO validation (via Spring Validation annotations), and HTTP status code selection. Controllers contain no business logic.

#### Service Layer (Business Logic Layer)
The Service Layer owns all business logic and orchestration. It receives validated inputs from the Controller Layer, applies business rules, invokes one or more Repository Layer components for data access, and returns processed results to the controller. The Service Layer is also responsible for transaction management, cache interaction (Redis), and external service calls (AI provider). This layer is where all domain rules — such as vendor ownership validation, booking availability checks, and role permission enforcement — are implemented.

#### Repository Layer (Data Access Layer)
The Repository Layer abstracts all database interaction. It is implemented using Spring Data JPA repositories which extend standard CRUD interfaces and support custom JPQL queries. The Repository Layer is the only layer that communicates with the database. It returns JPA entity objects to the Service Layer, which maps them to DTOs before returning them to the Controller Layer.

#### Database Layer
The Database Layer consists of the PostgreSQL relational database and the Redis in-memory cache. PostgreSQL is the authoritative data store for all persistent platform data. Redis is used as a read-through cache for frequently accessed, infrequently changing data. The database schema is managed through Hibernate's schema validation or a migration tool such as Flyway.

#### External Integration Layer
The External Integration Layer encapsulates all outbound communication with external services — specifically the AI provider REST API. This layer is implemented as a dedicated integration component within the Service Layer, using Spring's `RestTemplate` or `WebClient` for HTTP communication. It handles request formatting, response parsing, timeout enforcement, and error handling for all external service calls.

## 4. Functional Requirements

Each functional requirement follows the format: **ID, Description, Actors, Preconditions, Main Flow, Alternative Flow, Postconditions**.

---

### 4.1 Authentication Module

---

**FR-BE-01: User Registration**

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **ID** | FR-BE-01 |
| **Description** | The system shall allow new users to self-register by providing their full name, email address, password, and intended role. |
| **Actors** | Unregistered User (Traveler or Vendor applicant) |
| **Preconditions** | The user does not have an existing account with the provided email address. |
| **Main Flow** | 1. User submits a registration request with name, email, password, and role. 2. System validates all fields for completeness and format. 3. System verifies the email is not already registered. 4. System hashes the password using BCrypt. 5. System persists the new user record. Vendor accounts are assigned Pending Approval status. 6. System returns a 201 Created response. |
| **Alternative Flow** | If the email already exists, the system returns a 409 Conflict response. If any required field is missing or invalid, the system returns a 400 Bad Request response. |
| **Postconditions** | A new user record exists in the database. Vendor accounts remain inactive pending admin approval. |

---

**FR-BE-02: User Login and JWT Generation**

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **ID** | FR-BE-02 |
| **Description** | The system shall authenticate users via email and password and return a signed JWT access token upon success. |
| **Actors** | Registered User (Traveler, Vendor, Admin) |
| **Preconditions** | The user has an active registered account. |
| **Main Flow** | 1. User submits login request with email and password. 2. System retrieves user record by email. 3. System verifies the submitted password against the stored BCrypt hash. 4. System checks that the account status is Active or Approved. 5. System generates a signed JWT containing user ID, role, and expiry. 6. System returns the JWT access token and user role in the response body. |
| **Alternative Flow** | If the email does not exist or the password does not match, the system returns 401 Unauthorized. If the account is Suspended or Pending, the system returns 403 Forbidden with an appropriate message. |
| **Postconditions** | The client holds a valid JWT for use in subsequent authenticated requests. |

---

**FR-BE-03: JWT Token Validation**

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **ID** | FR-BE-03 |
| **Description** | The system shall validate the JWT token on every request to a protected endpoint before any service logic is executed. |
| **Actors** | System (Spring Security Filter) |
| **Preconditions** | A request to a protected endpoint has been received. |
| **Main Flow** | 1. The JWT filter intercepts the incoming request. 2. The filter extracts the token from the Authorization: Bearer header. 3. The filter verifies the token signature using the configured signing secret. 4. The filter checks the token's expiry timestamp. 5. The filter extracts the user ID and role and populates the Spring Security context. 6. The request proceeds to the controller. |
| **Alternative Flow** | If the header is absent, the token is malformed, the signature is invalid, or the token is expired, the filter returns 401 Unauthorized and the request does not reach the controller. |
| **Postconditions** | The Security Context holds the authenticated user's identity and role for use by the service layer. |

## 8. Security Requirements

### 8.1 JWT Validation Requirements

- Every protected endpoint must be guarded by the JWT validation filter before any service logic executes.
- The JWT must be signed with HMAC-SHA256 (HS256) using a minimum 256-bit secret key stored in environment configuration.
- Tokens have a maximum expiry of 1 hour for access tokens and 7 days for refresh tokens.
- The user role embedded in the JWT must match the user's role in the database at the time of request processing.
- Any JWT with a missing, invalid, or expired signature must result in an immediate 401 Unauthorized response.

### 8.3 Input Validation Requirements

- All incoming request bodies are validated using Bean Validation (Jakarta Validation 3.x) annotations on DTO classes.
- String fields are validated for maximum length, format constraints, and non-blank requirements.
- Numeric fields are validated for positive values and defined range limits.
- Date fields are validated for correct format and logical ordering (check-out > check-in).
- All database queries use parameterized JPA queries; no raw SQL string concatenation is permitted.
- File upload requests (photos) validate file type and maximum size at the service layer.

```mermaid

```

### 8.4 Password Security

- All passwords are hashed using BCrypt with a minimum cost factor of 12 before database persistence.
- Password hashes are never returned in any API response.
- Password reset flows are managed through time-limited, single-use tokens delivered via email (email integration is a future enhancement).

### 8.5 Sensitive Data Handling

- JWT tokens are never written to application logs.
- Password fields are excluded from all DTO mappings that produce API responses.
- Internal database IDs (UUIDs) are used in API responses; sequential integer IDs are not exposed.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph PWD_SEC["Password Security — 8.4"]
        PS1["BCrypt hash\ncost factor ≥ 12\nbefore any DB persistence"]

## 9. Error Handling

### 9.1 Standard Error Response Format

All error responses from the backend must conform to the following JSON structure, ensuring consistency across all endpoints and enabling client-side error handling to be uniform.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-28T10:45:00Z",
  "status": 400,
  "errorCode": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
  "message": "One or more fields failed validation.",
  "details": [
    {
      "field": "checkOutDate",
      "issue": "Check-out date must be after check-in date."
    }
  ],
  "path": "/bookings"
}
```

### 9.2 HTTP Status Code Standards

| **HTTP Status** | **Error Code** | **Business Scenario** |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `VALIDATION_FAILED` | Request body fails field-level validation |
| 400 | `INVALID_REFERENCE` | A foreign key field references a non-existent entity |
| 401 | `TOKEN_MISSING` | Authorization header absent on protected endpoint |
| 401 | `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | JWT token has passed its expiry timestamp |
| 401 | `TOKEN_INVALID` | JWT signature validation failed |
| 401 | `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | Login email/password combination is incorrect |
| 403 | `ACCESS_DENIED` | Authenticated user's role does not permit the requested operation |
| 403 | `OWNERSHIP_VIOLATION` | Vendor attempts to modify another vendor's resource |
| 403 | `ACCOUNT_INACTIVE` | Account is Suspended, Pending, or Deactivated |
| 404 | `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` | Requested entity does not exist |
| 409 | `DUPLICATE_EMAIL` | Registration attempt with an already registered email |
| 409 | `ROOM_NOT_AVAILABLE` | Room has insufficient availability for the requested dates |
| 409 | `INVALID_STATUS_TRANSITION` | Booking status change is not permitted from current status |
| 422 | `CANCELLATION_WINDOW_EXPIRED` | Cancellation request received after the allowed window |
| 500 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unhandled server-side exception |
| 503 | `AI_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | External AI provider did not respond within the timeout |

### 9.3 Business Exception Hierarchy

The backend defines a structured exception hierarchy that maps cleanly to HTTP responses through a centralized `@ControllerAdvice` exception handler. No raw exceptions or stack traces are ever exposed to the API consumer.

```mermaid

## 11. Domain Model (DDD)

The backend system is organized around five bounded contexts, each representing a cohesive business domain with its own entities, value objects, and service responsibilities. Inter-domain communication occurs through shared identifiers (UUIDs) and well-defined service interfaces.

---

### 11.1 User Domain

**Bounded Context:** Identity and Access Management

**Entities:**
- `User` — The root aggregate. Represents any registered account on the platform (Traveler, Vendor, or Admin).

**Value Objects:**
- `Email` — A validated email address string associated with a User.
- `PasswordHash` — The BCrypt-hashed representation of a user's password; never exposed outside the domain.
- `AccountStatus` — An enumerated value representing the lifecycle state of an account: PENDING, ACTIVE, APPROVED, SUSPENDED, DEACTIVATED, REJECTED.
- `UserRole` — An enumerated value: TRAVELER, VENDOR, ADMIN.

**Domain Services:**
- `AuthService` — Handles registration, login, JWT generation, and credential validation.
- `UserService` — Handles profile retrieval, profile updates, and account status management.

**Domain Rules:**
- A User may not change their own role.
- A User in SUSPENDED or DEACTIVATED status cannot authenticate.
- A VENDOR user in PENDING status cannot access vendor-specific endpoints.
- Password hashes are the only permitted representation of user credentials in the domain.

### 11.2 Accommodation Domain

**Bounded Context:** Hotel and Room Management

**Entities:**
- `Hotel` — Root aggregate representing a lodging property. Owned by a Vendor user.
- `Room` — A room type entity within a Hotel, containing pricing, capacity, and availability data.

**Value Objects:**
- `HotelStatus` — ACTIVE or INACTIVE.
- `RoomStatus` — ACTIVE or INACTIVE.
- `Price` — A positive decimal value with an associated currency code.
- `AvailableQuantity` — A non-negative integer representing the number of available rooms of a given type.

**Domain Services:**
- `HotelService` — Manages Hotel CRUD operations, vendor ownership validation, and listing visibility filtering.
- `RoomService` — Manages Room CRUD operations, pricing validation, and availability tracking.

**Domain Rules:**
- A Hotel is only visible to travelers when its status is ACTIVE and its owning Vendor's status is APPROVED.
- A Vendor may only modify Hotels and Rooms that they own.
- Room pricing must be a positive, non-zero value.
- Available quantity may never fall below zero.

### 11.3 Travel Domain

**Bounded Context:** Booking and Route Management

**Entities:**
- `Booking` — Root aggregate representing a room booking request and its complete lifecycle.
- `Route` — An entity representing the travel path between two destinations.

**Value Objects:**
- `BookingStatus` — PENDING, CONFIRMED, DECLINED, CANCELLED.
- `DateRange` — A pair of check-in and check-out dates with built-in invariant validation (check-out > check-in).
- `TotalPrice` — The calculated total booking cost (nightly rate × number of nights).
- `Distance` — A decimal value in kilometers associated with a Route.
- `TravelDuration` — A string representation of estimated journey time.

**Domain Services:**
- `BookingService` — Manages the full booking lifecycle including availability verification, transactional status transitions, and history retrieval.
- `RouteService` — Manages route record CRUD and origin-destination query support.
- `AvailabilityChecker` — A domain service encapsulating the transactional availability check logic called by BookingService.

**Domain Rules:**
- A Booking may only be created if room availability is confirmed within a database transaction.
- Room availability is decremented only upon CONFIRMED transition, not on PENDING creation.
- A Booking may only be CANCELLED if the requesting traveler owns it and the cancellation window is open.
- A Route record requires both origin and destination to reference valid, active Destination entities.

## 12. Future Backend Enhancements

### 12.1 Payment Gateway Integration

A dedicated `PaymentService` will manage integration with one or more payment gateway providers, enabling travelers to complete financial transactions for hotel bookings directly through the platform API. This service will own a `Payment` entity linked to `Booking` records and will manage payment initiation, status polling, webhook-based confirmation handling, refund requests, and vendor settlement records. The Booking domain will be extended to include a payment status that governs whether a CONFIRMED booking has been financially settled.

### 12.2 Asynchronous Notification Service

A `NotificationService` will handle the delivery of event-driven communications — booking status updates, vendor approval decisions, account status changes — through email channels. This service will receive trigger events from other domain services and process notification dispatch asynchronously, ensuring that notification delivery does not block or delay the response of the originating business operation.

### 12.3 Analytics and Reporting Service

An `AnalyticsService` will aggregate platform activity data — including registration volumes, booking conversion rates, most-searched destinations, AI chatbot usage patterns, and vendor performance metrics — and expose this data through admin-facing reporting API endpoints. This service will operate on read replicas or aggregated reporting tables to avoid impacting the performance of the primary transactional database.

### 12.4 AI Recommendation Personalization Engine

The AI Integration Service will be enhanced with a personalization layer that builds a traveler interest profile from accumulated interaction data — chat history, browsing patterns, and booking behavior — and uses this profile to enrich AI requests with personalized context before forwarding them to the AI provider. This will result in progressively more relevant and accurate recommendations as a traveler's usage history grows.

### 12.5 Traveler Review and Rating Service

A `ReviewService` will manage traveler-submitted ratings and written reviews for hotels, tourist spots, and destinations. This service will include submission eligibility validation (only travelers with completed bookings may review a hotel), moderation status management (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED), aggregate rating calculation, and vendor response recording. Review data will be consumed by the search and recommendation services to influence result ranking.

### 12.6 Multi-Language Content API

A localization extension to the Local Experience Domain will support multi-language content records for all content categories. Each content entity will gain a one-to-many relationship with `ContentTranslation` records keyed by ISO language code. The API will return translated content based on the `Accept-Language` header of the incoming request, falling back to English if no translation exists for the requested language.
